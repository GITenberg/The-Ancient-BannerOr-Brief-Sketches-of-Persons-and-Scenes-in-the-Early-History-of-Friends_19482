<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">In boundless mercy, the Redeemer left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bosom of his Father, and assumed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A servant's form, though he had reigned a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In realms of glory, ere the worlds were made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the creating words, "Let there be light"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven were uttered. But though veiled in flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Deity and his Omnipotence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were manifest in miracles. Disease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled at his bidding, and the buried dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose from the sepulchre, reanimate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his command, or, on the passing bier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat upright, when he touched it. But he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not for this only, but to introduce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious dispensation, in the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of types and shadows of the Jewish code.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the mount, and round Jerusalem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He taught a purer, and a holier law,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His everlasting Gospel, which is yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill the earth with gladness; for all climes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall feel its influence, and shall own its power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He came to suffer, as a sacrifice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acceptable to God. The sins of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were laid upon Him, when in agony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bowed upon the cross. The temple's veil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was rent asunder, and the mighty rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembled, as the incarnate Deity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his atoning blood, opened that door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which the soul, can have communion with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its great Creator; and when purified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all defilements, find acceptance too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where it can finally partake of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joys of His salvation.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the pure Church he planted,&mdash;the pure Church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which his apostles watered,&mdash;and for which,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood of countless martyrs freely flowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Roman Amphitheatres,&mdash;on racks,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the dungeon's gloom,&mdash;this blessed Church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which grew in suffering, when it overspread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrounding nations, lost its purity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its truth was hidden, and its light obscured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By gross corruption, and idolatry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As things of worship, it had images,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even painted canvas was adored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It had a head and bishop, but this head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not the Saviour, but the Pope of Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Religion was a traffic. Men defiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Professed to pardon sin, and even sell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joys of heaven for money,&mdash;and to raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Souls out of darkness to eternal light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For paltry silver lavished upon them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus thick darkness, overspread the Church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with a mantle.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At length the midnight of apostacy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed by, and in the horizon appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day dawning upon Christendom. The light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew stronger, as the Reformation spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Luther, and Melancthon, could not be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silenced by papal bulls, nor by decrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of excommunication thundered forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the Vatican. And yet the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Luther's reformation, never reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the morning's dawn. The noontide blaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Truth's unclouded day, he never saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet after him, its rising sun displayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More and more light upon the horizon.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though thus enlightened, the professing Church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was far from many of the precious truths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Redeemer's gospel; and as yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Owned not his Spirit's government therein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the time approached, when he would pour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A larger measure of his light below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he chose unlearned fishermen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spread his gospel when first introduced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So now he passed mere human learning by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chose an instrument, comparable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the small stone the youthful David used,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To smite the champion who defied the Lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Apart from human dwellings, in a green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich pasturage of England, sat a youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seemed a shepherd, for around him there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flock was feeding, and the sportive lambs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gambolled amid the herbage. But his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore evidence of sadness. On his knee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred book lay open, upon which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth looked long and earnestly, and then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closing the book, gazed upward, in deep thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the instrument by whom the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Designed to spread a clearer light below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fuller reformation. He appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ancient Samuel, to be set apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Lord's service from his very birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in early childhood, he refrained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From youthful follies, and his mind was turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To things of highest moment. He was filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With awful feelings, by the wickedness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw around him. As he grew in years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horror of sin grew stronger; and his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Became so clothed with sadness, and so full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of soul-felt longings, for the healing streams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heavenly consolation, that he left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His earthly kindred, seeking quietude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In solitary places, where he read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The book of inspiration, and in prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought heavenly counsel.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In this deep-proving season he was told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of priests, whose reputation had spread wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sanctity and wisdom; and from these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought for consolation,&mdash;but in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of these ministers became enraged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the youth had inadvertently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misstepped within his garden; and a priest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of greater reputation, counselled him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To use tobacco, and sing holy psalms!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the inquirer found a third to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as an empty, hollow cask at best.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Finding no help in man, the youthful Fox,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned to a higher and a holier source,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For light and knowledge. In his Saviour's school,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sat a scholar, and was clearly shown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep corruption, that had overspread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Professing Christendom. And one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doctrines of the Gospel, were unveiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the attentive student,&mdash;doctrines, which,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though clearly written on the sacred page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had long been hidden, by the rubbish man's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perversions and inventions heaped thereon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw that colleges, could not confer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A saving knowledge of the way of Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor qualify a minister to preach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The everlasting Gospel; but that Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the true Teacher, and that he alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has power to call, anoint, and qualify,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And send a Gospel minister to preach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad tidings of salvation. He was shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No outward building, made of wood and stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could be a holy place,&mdash;and that the Church&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only true and living Church&mdash;must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A holy people gathered to the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his teaching. He was clearly taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nature of baptism, by which souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are purified and fitted for this Church;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this was not, by being dipped into,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sprinkled with clear water, but it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one baptism of the Holy Ghost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the Supper was no outward food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made and administered by human hands,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Lord's Table was within the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in communion with him, holy bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was blessed and broken, and the heavenly wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which cheers the fainting spirit, handed forth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saviour showed him that all outward wars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are now forbidden,&mdash;that the warfare here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is to be waged within. Its weapons too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though mighty, even to the pulling down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the strong holds of Satan, are yet all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Spirit's weapons. He was shown, that oaths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judicial or profane, are banished from<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Christian dispensation, which commands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Swear not at all." He saw the compliments,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hat honour, and lip service of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang from pride's evil root, and were opposed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the pure spirit of Christ's holy law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by His inward Light, was clearly seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The perfect purity of heart and life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which that Saviour calls, who never asked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things unattainable.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These truths and others, being thus revealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fox was prepared and qualified to preach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unveiled Gospel, to the sons of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed with divine authority, he went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abroad through Britain, and proclaimed that Light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Christ's illuminating Spirit sheds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dark heart of man. Some heard of this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seemed prepared and waiting, to receive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Gospel message, and were turned to Him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose Holy Spirit sealed it on their hearts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a few of these, were called upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take the message, and themselves declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way of Truth to others. But the Priests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carnal professors, and some magistrates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard of the inward light, and purity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With indignation, and they seized upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust the Preacher within prison walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not once alone, but often was he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the very dregs of wickedness&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With robbers, and with blood-stained criminals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Locked up in loathsome jails. And when abroad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his Master's service, he was still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reviled and buffeted, and spit upon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But none of these things moved him, for within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt that soul-sustaining evidence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which bore his spirit high above the waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bitter persecution.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But now the time approached, for his release<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From suffering and from labour. He had spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long years in travel for the cause of Truth,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not all in Britain,&mdash;for he preached its light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And power in Holland,&mdash;the West Indian isles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And North America. Far through the wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trackless wilderness, this faithful man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carried his Master's message; he lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see Truth's banner fearlessly displayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon both continents. He lived to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure hearted men and women gathered to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inward teaching of the Saviour's will,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banded together in the covenant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of light and life. But his allotted work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was now accomplished, and his soul prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For an inheritance with saints in light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his loins all girded, he put off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His earthly shackles, triumphing in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Seed reigned, and Truth was over all!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the dark waters of the Delaware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll onward to the ocean, sweeping by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Primeval forests, where the red man still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built his rude wigwam, and the timid deer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled for concealment from the Indian's eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the unerring arrow of his bow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, in the shadow of these ancient woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sea-worn ship has anchored. On her deck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men of grave mien are gathered. One of whom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of noble figure, and quick searching eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surveys the scene, wrapt in the deepest thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is William Penn. He stands among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fellow believers, who have sought a home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And place of refuge, in this wilderness.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Born of an ancient family, his sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An English Admiral, the youthful Penn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might, with his talents, have soon ranked among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proudest subjects of the British throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He chose the better part&mdash;to serve that King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is immortal and invisible.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet a student within college halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard Truth's message, and his heart was reached,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fully owned it, though it came through one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that despised and persecuted class,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called in derision Quakers. Thus convinced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left the college worship, to commune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spirit with his Maker. And for this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was expelled from Oxford; and was soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maltreated by his father, who, enraged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because his only son, had turned away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From brilliant prospects, to pursue the path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of self-denial, drove him harshly forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the paternal roof. But William Penn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had still a Father, who supported him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With strength and courage to perform his will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he was called and qualified to preach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to bear witness of that blessed Light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shines within. He suffered in the cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His share of trial. He was dragged before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judges and juries, and was shut within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls of prisons.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Looking abroad through England, he was filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deep commiseration, for the jails&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loathsome, filthy jails&mdash;were crowded with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brethren in the Truth. For their relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought the ear of royalty, and plead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cruel sufferings; and their innocence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus became the instrument through which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some prison doors were opened. But he sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A place of refuge from oppression's power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Friends might worship the Creator there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free from imprisonment and penalties.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such a place soon opened to his view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far in the Western Wilderness, beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Atlantic's wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And here is William Penn, and here a band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of weary emigrants, who now behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The promised land before them; but it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Indian's country, and the Indian's home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Penn had indeed, received a royal grant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To occupy it; but a grant from one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had no rightful ownership therein;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He therefore buys it honestly from those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose claims are aboriginal, and just.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these inhabitants, behold, he stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath an ancient elm, whose spreading limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erhang the Delaware. The forest chiefs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit in grave silence, while the pipe of peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes round the circle. They have made a league<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With faithful Onas&mdash;a perpetual league,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And treaty of true friendship, to endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the sun shines, and while the waters run.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And here was founded in the wilderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A refuge from oppression, where all creeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found toleration, and where truth and right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the foundation of its government,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its protection. In that early day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The infant colony sought no defence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that of justice and of righteousness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only guarantees of peace on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they ever breathe, good will to men.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His colony thus planted, William Penn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought his old field of labour, and again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both through the press and vocally, he plead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The right of conscience, and the rights of man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frequently, and forcibly he preached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christ's universal and inshining Light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His labour was incessant; and the cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the perplexities connected with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His distant province, which he visited<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A second time, bore heavily upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His burdened spirit, which demanded rest;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rest was granted. In the midst of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His labour and his trials, there was drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A veil, in mercy, round his active mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which dimmed all outward things; but he still saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty and the loveliness of Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found sweet access to the Source of good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, shut out from the perplexities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sorrows of the world, he was prepared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the final summons, to put off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tattered garments, and be clothed upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heavenly raiment.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Scotland, thou hadst a noble citizen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him of Ury! Born amid thy hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though educated where enticing scenes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowd giddy Paris, he rejected all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world's allurements, and unlike the youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who talked with Jesus, Barclay turned away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From great possessions, and embraced the Truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He early dedicated all the powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a well cultivated intellect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Redeemer and His holy cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a herald, to proclaim aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad tidings of salvation; and his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preached a loud sermon by its purity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only were his lips made eloquent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the live coal that touched them, but his pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved by a force from the same altar, poured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light, truth, and wisdom. From it issued forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great Apology, which yet remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of the best expositors of Truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That man has published, since that sacred book<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anciently written. Seekers are still led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By its direction, to that blessed Light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And inward Teacher, who is Jesus Christ.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, this noble servant of the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rests from his faithful labour, while his works<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet follow him.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Early believers in the light of Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt not at ease in Zion. They endured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conflicts and trials, and imprisonments.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the humble Penington, whose mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed purged and purified from all the dross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human nature&mdash;who appeared as meek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And harmless as an infant&mdash;was compelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dwell in loathsome prisons. But he had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though in the midst of wickedness, sublime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holy visions of the purity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the true nature of Christ's living Church.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Edmundson, the faithful pioneer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Truth in Ireland, was compelled to drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deeply of suffering for the blessed cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragged from his home, half naked, by a mob<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who laid that home in ashes, he endured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart-rending cruelties. But all of these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stars of the morning, felt oppression's hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some endured it to the closing scene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burroughs, a noble servant of the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose lips and pen were eloquent for Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew his last breath in prison. Parnel, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A young and valiant soldier of the Lamb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died, a true martyr in a dungeon's gloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howgill and Hubberthorn, both ministers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Christ's ordaining, were released from all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their earthly trials within prison walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beside these, there was a multitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of faithful men, and noble women too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who past from scenes of conflict, to the joys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Redeemer's kingdom, within jails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some in dungeons. But amid it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light spread in Britain, and a living Church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was greatly multiplied. The tender minds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even of children, felt the power of Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed the fruit and firmness it affords.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When persecution, rioted within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The town of Bristol, and all older Friends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were locked in prison, little children met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within their place of worship, by themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To offer praises, in the very place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which their parents had been dragged to jail.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But let us turn from Britain, and look down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon an inland sea whose swelling waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encircle Malta. There a cloudless sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Eastern beauty, pours its light upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Inquisition. All without its walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems calm and peaceful, let us look within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, stretched upon the floor, within a close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark, narrow cell, inhaling from a crack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A breath of purer air, two women lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who are these, and wherefore are they here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are two ministers of Christ, who left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their homes in England, faithfully to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saviour's message into eastern lands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here at Malta they were seized upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By bigotted intolerance, and shut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within this fearful engine of the Pope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Priests and Inquisitor assail them here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And urge the claims of popery. The rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cruel deaths are threatened; and again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet liberty is offered, as the price<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their apostacy. All, all in vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For years these tender women have been thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Victims of cruelty. At times apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confined in gloomy, solitary cells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all these efforts to convert them failed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Inquisition had not power enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shake their faith and confidence in Him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose holy presence was seen anciently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save his children from devouring flames;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, from this furnace of affliction, brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These persecuted women, who came forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the burning, with no smell of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon their garments, and again they trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their native land rejoicing.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In Hungary, two ministers of Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were stretched upon the rack. Their tortured limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were almost torn asunder, but no force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could tear them from their Master, and they came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the furnace, well refined gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor were these all who suffered for the cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of truth and righteousness, in foreign lands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For at Mequinez and Algiers, some toiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died in slavery. But nothing could<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discourage faithful messengers of Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his required service. They were found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preaching repentance where the Israelites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once toiled in Egypt, and the ancient Nile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still rolls its waters. And the holy light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the eternal Gospel was proclaimed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where its great Author had first published it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the rich temple of King Solomon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood in its ancient glory. Even there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty Musselmen, were told of Him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one great Prophet, who now speaks within.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For their refusing to participate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In carnal warfare, many early Friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were made to suffer. On a ship of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equipped for battle, Richard Sellers bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a meek, Christian spirit, cruelties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most atrocious, for obeying Him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was his heavenly Captain, and by whom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War is forbidden. Sellers would not touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The instruments of carnage, nor could all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cruelties inflicted, move his soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a reliance on that holy Arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which had sustained him in the midst of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His complicated trials; and he gained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A peaceful, but a greater victory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than that of battle, for he wearied out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppression, by his constancy, and left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A holy savor, with that vessel's crew.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But let us turn from persecuting scenes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stain the annals of the older world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To young America, whose virgin shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offer a refuge from oppression's power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here lies a harbour in the noble bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Massachusetts. Many little isles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dot its expanding waters, and Nahant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spreads its long beach and eminence beyond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A barrier to the ocean. The whole scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks beautiful, in the clear northern air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loveliness of morning. On the heights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That overlook the harbour, there is seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An infant settlement. Let us approach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And anchor where the Puritans have sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For liberty of conscience. But there seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disquietude in Boston. Men appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urged on by stormy passions, and some wear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A look of unrelenting bitterness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what is that now rising into view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where crowds are gathered on an eminence?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the Puritans. They now surround<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A common gallows. On its platform, stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lovely woman in the simple garb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn by the early Quakers. Of the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She only seems unmoved, although her blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They madly thirst for.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The first professors of Christ's inward Light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who brought this message into Boston bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were inoffensive women. They were searched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For signs of witchcraft, and their books were burned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captain who had brought them, was compelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To carry them away. But others came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both men and women, zealous for the Truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These were received with varied cruelties&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By frequent whippings and imprisonments.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Law after law was made excluding them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all in vain, for still these faithful ones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carried their Master's message undismayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the Puritans, and still they found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who received it, and embraced the Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And steadily maintained it, in the midst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whipping posts, and pillories, and jails!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A law was then enacted, by which all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The banished Quakers, who were found again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the province, were to suffer death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But these, though ever ready to obey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All just enactments, when laws trespassed on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rights of conscience, and on God's command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could never for a moment hesitate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to obey.&mdash;And soon there stood upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scaffold of New England, faithful friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, in obeying Christ, offended man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these was Mary Dyer, who exclaimed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While passing to this instrument of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No eye can witness, and no ear can hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tongue can utter, nor heart understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The incomes and refreshings from the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which now I feel." And in the spirit which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These words a little pictured, Robinson,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past to the presence of that Holy One<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom he laboured, and in whom he died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Stevenson, another faithful steward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And servant of the Lamb, was ushered from<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep scenes of suffering into scenes of joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Mary Dyer, who was all prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To join these martyrs in their heavenward flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was left a little longer upon earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a few fleeting months had rolled away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere this devoted woman felt constrained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again to go among the Puritans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Massachusetts, and in Boston too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here she stands! the second time, upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gallows of New England. No reprieve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrests her sentence now. But still she feels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same sweet incomes, and refreshing streams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Lord's Holy Spirit. In the midst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that excited multitude, she seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most resigned and peaceful.&mdash;But the deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is now accomplished, and the scene is closed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the faithful martyrs of the Lamb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathered forever round His Holy Throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She doubtless wears a pure and spotless robe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bears the palm of victory.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The blood of Leddra was soon after shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which closed the scene of martyrdom among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The early Quakers in this colony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not the scene of suffering. Women were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragged through its towns half-naked, tied to carts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the lash fell upon their unclothed backs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bloody streets, showed where they past along.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such inhuman treatment was bestowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the first female minister of Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who preached the doctrine of his inward Light.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But in New England, there was really found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A refuge from oppression, justice reigned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon Rhode Island. In that early day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rights of conscience were held sacred there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And persecution was a thing unknown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bright example, as a governor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was William Coddington. He loved the law&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The perfect law of righteousness&mdash;and strove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To govern by it; and all faithful Friends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt him a brother in the blessed Truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In North America, the Puritans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood not alone in efforts to prevent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The introduction and the spread of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Dutch plantation of New Amsterdam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustained a measure of the evil work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The savage cruelties inflicted on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faithful Hodgson, have few parallels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In any age or country; but the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was with His servant in the midst of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And healed his tortured and his mangled frame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The early Friends were bright and shining stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they reflected the clear holy light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sun of Righteousness bestowed on them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They followed no deceiving, transient glare&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No ignis fatuus of bewildered minds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They followed Jesus in the holiness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of His unchanging Gospel. They endured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stripes and imprisonment and pillories,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torture and slavery and banishment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even death; but they would not forsake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their Holy Leader, or His blessed cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their patient suffering, and firm steadfastness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secured a rich inheritance for those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have succeeded them. Do these now feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That firm devotion to the cause of Truth&mdash;That<br /></span>
<span class="i0">singleheartedness their fathers felt?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do they appreciate the price and worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the great legacy and precious trust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held for their children? The great cruelties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne by the fathers, have not been entailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their descendants, who now dwell at ease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world does not revile them. Do not some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love it the more for this? and do they not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make more alliance with it, and partake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More and more freely of its tempting baits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its fashions and its spirit? but are these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More pure and holy than they were of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in the light of Truth, their fathers saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That deep corruption overspread the world?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Other professors latterly have learned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak of Quakers with less bitterness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than when the name reproachfully was cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ridicule upon them. Has not this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn watchmen from the citadel of Truth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has it not opened doors that had been closed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should have been forever? And by these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has not an enemy been stealing in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spoil the goods of many; to assail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strive in secrecy to gather strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To overcome the citadel at last?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it not thought illiberal to refuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alliances with those who now profess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respect and friendship? Must the Quaker then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bow in the house of Rimmon, saying, Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pardon in this thy servant? Do not some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fail to resist encroachments, when they come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in enticing words, and wear the guise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of charity and kindness, and are veiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sweetened to the taste, by courtesy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But is a snare less certain, when concealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By some enticing bait? or is a ball<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less sure and fatal, when it flies unheard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, when the hand that sends it is unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or offers friendship? Did not Joab say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Art thou in health my brother?" and appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kiss Amasa, while he thrust his sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into his life-blood? And when Jonas fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Lord's service, and the stormy waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threatened the ship that bore him, was the cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not found within it? Was there not a calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he, whose disobedience to the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had raised the tempest, was no longer there?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Truth has a standard openly displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untorn&mdash;unsullied. Man indeed may change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may forsake it; but the Standard still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remains immutable. May all who love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Holy Banner, rally to it now!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May all whose dwellings are upon the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek for a building on that living Rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which stands forever;&mdash;for a storm has come&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A storm that tries foundations! Even now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flooding rains are falling, and the winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rapidly rising to a tempest, beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon all dwellings. They alone can stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which have the Rock beneath them, and above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Omnipresent and Omnipotent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creator and Defender of His Church!<br /></span>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
